Steps to Deploy on JBoss Fuse

1. Clone the code from github:  www.github.com/redhat-gpe/OPEN_Admin.git

2. IF running locally and using Maven

2.1 Copy config file com.redhat.gpe.lms.ipaldap.cfg to $fuse_home/etc

2.2 Build the application locally

  cd OPEN_Admin/lms_integration_ipa_ldap
  mvn clean install

3. IF building locally and deploying remotely

3.1 Build the application locally

  cd OPEN_Admin/lms_integration_ipa_ldap
  mvn clean package

3.2 Copy the lms JAR file up to server

  scp target/lms-integration-ipa-ldap-1.0.0.jar <your-opentlc-account>@<<remote-server>>:lms-ipa-ldap

3.2. Copy the lms feature file up to server

  scp lms-ipa-ldap-features.xml <your-opentlc-account>@<<remote-server>>:lms-ipa-ldap

3.2. Copy the lms configuration file up to server

  scp com.redhat.gpe.lms.ipaldap.cfg <your-opentlc-account>@<<remote-server>>:lms-ipa-ldap

3.3. Copy the unirest-jar file up to server
   Note: see "how-to-create-unirest-jar-with-dependencies.txt" for details on creating this file

  scp ${unirest.build.dir}/target/unirest-java-1.4.8-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar <your-opentlc-account>@<<remote-server>>:lms
      
4. Connect to remote server

  ssh <your-opentlc-account>@<<remote-server>>


5. Start JBoss Fuse (if not running)

  cd ${fuse.home}

  bin/start

6. Check the status

Wait about 30 seconds for the server to start. You can check the status with the following command

  bin/status

If it says, "Running..." then you can proceed to the next step.

8. Start Fuse Admin client

  bin/client

9. Install the LMS-IPA-LDAP features

9.1 Copy the properties file to ${fuse.home}/etc

  cp com.redhat.gpe.lms.ipaldap.cfg ${fuse.home}/etc

9.1 Copy the features file to ${fuse.home}

  cp lms-ipa-ldap-features.xml ${fuse.home}

9.2 Install the Unirest HTTP JAR file in the Maven Repo

  mvn install:install-file -Dfile=unirest-java-1.4.8-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -DgroupId=com.mashape.unirest -DartifactId=unirest-java -Dversion=1.4.8-with-dependencies -Dpackaging=jar

9.2 Add the LMS Features
Run the following commands at the Karaf CLI:

  features:addUrl file:${fuse.home}/lms-ipa-ldap-features.xml
  features:refreshUrl  
  features:install lms-ipa-ldap/1.0
  
9.3 Add the LMS app code

  # If installing from file system
  osgi:install -s file:/home/fuse/lms/lms-integration-ipa-ldap-1.0.0.jar

  # If installing from Maven
  osgi:install -s mvn:com.redhat.gpe/lms-integration-ipa-ldap/1.0.0
  
10. View the Fuse logs to make sure the app started. Enter the following command at the Karaf CLI:

  log:display | grep lms.ipaldap

You should see....

  ... (CamelContext: lms-ipaldap) started

That means the app is installed successfully.

Monitoring Logs
===============
1. You can view the logs. First start the Fuse Admin client

  bin/client

2. View the log tails with

   log:tail

3. If you want to see the DEBUG logs for this app

   log:set DEBUG com.redhat.gpe
   
4. Then you can view the debug messages with

   log:tail
   
5. To set it back to info level, just do

   log:set DEBUG com.redhat.gpe

Managing Properties
===================

Note: It is not hot deploy lookup for changes. You need to manually restart your bundle

Run the Fuse CLI

When editing a configuration the commands are used as follows:
	1. Start the editing session for the specified configuration.

               JBossFuse:karaf@root> config:edit com.redhat.gpe.lms.ipaldap

     2. Lists the properties in the configuration.
               
               JBossFuse:karaf@root> config:proplist


     3. Set the value for a configuration property.
               config:propset propertyName propertyValue

              JBossFuse:karaf@root> config:propset email.username tester

     4. Save the settings

               JBossFuse:karaf@root> config:update

     5. Now restart the Camel Bundle to pick up new properties
          
               JBossFuse:karaf@root> osgi:restart <bundleId>
